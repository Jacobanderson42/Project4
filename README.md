# Problem Statement
This project is looking to analyze the sounds that are present in the ocean. Specifically, the first part of this project is looking at 
the effect of rain and wind on ambient ocean noise. The second part of this project looks at the sounds created by marine mammals, 
airguns, and earthquake activity. Generating these profiles can help to identify different sounds that are present in a recording.

# Background/Solution/Results
Hydrophones are part of the instrument package that is used by the Ocean Observatories to gather data. The data that hydrophones collect 
is about sound. Using this data different sound profiles can be analyzed to determine what sounds are present at any given time. This 
data can be used to create spectrograms that show different patterns in sound over a period of time. To analyze this data from the OOI 
website, a python code was written that imports the data, using a url, and then creates either a PSD vs time graph or a spectrograph.

These functions take in the url for a given node and time, a duration of time to plot, and a title for the graph. From the first 
function, the data is separated and the power spectral density is calculated as an average of 1 second intervals. With this power 
spectral density, the decibel level is then calculated. This power spectral density is then plotted versus the frequency. This allows 
for the sound present at different frequencies to be analyzed to determine what may be causing the sound. The second function takes 
these inputs and generates a spectrogram that shows the PSD as a function of time and frequency by using a color gradient for the PSD. 
This allows for analyzing different patterns in the PSD that change over time.

Graphs from times of different combinations of windy and rainy times were created for two different locations. Spectrograms were also 
created that feature sounds of marine mammals, airguns, and earthquake activity. All of these graphs can be seen below.

# Conclusions
It can be seen from the graphs above that there is very little variation in PSD for times that are windy and/or rainy. The PSD levels 
for each location and for each different combination of wind and rain showed very little variation. Looking at the Wenz curve it can be 
seen that heavy precipitation causes a spectrum level of about 80dB over a frequency range of 100-10,000 Hz. This is similar for bubble 
spray and noise caused by wind. Looking at the graphs that were generated, it can be seen that every graph shows a general trend of PSD 
values in the range of 40-80. The noise that is generated by wind and rain is included in this data but because of the ambient noise, it 
appears that the wind and rain cannot be differentiated in this data. Based on this data it appears that both wind and rain have the 
same impact on the power spectral density. Looking at the Wenz curve, we would expect that the rain would have more impact as it has 
higher levels, over the same frequency range. Looking at the difference between the two sites it appears that there is no impact on the 
change between no weather activity and times of heavy weather. In comparing the two to each other, it appears that the offshore array 
tends to have less overall ambient noise. This is likely due to its location relative to shore as compared to the shelf array.

The spectrogram for the marine mammal noise shows that there are multiple harmonics of the same shape at varying frequencies from 0 to 
over 5000 Hz. This is consistent with the Wenz curve that shows the frequency range for biologics from around 8 to over 100,000 Hz. The 
airgun spectrogram shows spikes of high PSD over a wide range of frequencies from 0 to over 2000 Hz. These spikes also occur at even 
intervals of time. This is consistent with what is expected for airguns as they fire at even time intervals over a wide range of 
frequencies of about 100 to about 50000 Hz. The spectrogram for the earthquake shows a rise in the low frequency noise that tends to 
always be present. The frequency range of high PSD can be seen to rise up into the range of 0 to 100Hz which is what is to be expected 
based on the Wenz curve.

# Problem Statement
This project is looking to analyze the sounds that are present in the ocean. Specifically, the first part of this project is looking at 
the effect of rain and wind on ambient ocean noise. The second part of this project looks at the sounds created by marine mammals, 
airguns, and earthquake activity. Generating these profiles can help to identify different sounds that are present in a recording.
